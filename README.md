# UrbanPotager v1.0
UrbanPotager - Smart Indoor Kitchen Garden Project

##Concept
The Urban Potager project is a small open-source automated indoor garden, developed by UrbanaPlant in partnership with the FabLab at the University of Gennevilliers, France. The goal of this project is to design and implement a compact micro-garden which can be installed in any household that doesn't have an outdoor space for growing plants (garden, terrace, balcony) with little sunlight exposure.

##Features
The Urban Potager has been designed to help you grow your plants as simply as possible, by using innovative technologies and precise control of the environment. In addition, thanks to its small footprint and customizable structure, the Urban Potager easily fits in your space!

##Three words
**Automated**: Automated watering / Smart lighting / Optimized growth / Water level alert

**Smart**: Temperature sensor / Humidity sensor / Water level sensor / Light sensor

**Functional**: Small footprint / Suitable for small areas / Quiet and discreet / Customizable
Collaborative: Open-Source / Open-Hardware / Scalable / Educational

And more to come!
